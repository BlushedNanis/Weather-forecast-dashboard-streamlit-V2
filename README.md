# Weather forecast dashboard V2

This project is an improved version of the one made during the "Python Mega Course" by Ardit Sulce.

Web-app focused in forecasting the weather in a determined city for a maximun of 5 days ahead, the user will be able to view charts for temperature, wind, humidity and a basic but intuitive tab for weather conditions.

The whole web part of the project is based on streamlit, due to the simple interface and functionality.

The weather forecast is provided by openweathermap.org API.
